## Tone & Voice Guidelines

### Professional but Personable
```
TOO FORMAL:
"It is herein submitted that the undersigned has undertaken 
the development of a visual effects system..."

TOO CASUAL:
"I made this super cool VFX thing that's literally insane"

JUST RIGHT:
"I developed a custom particle system that achieves cinematic 
visual effects with optimized performance."
```

### Show Your Skills, Don't Tell Them
```
WEAK:
"I'm really good at visual effects"

STRONG:
"I created a cloth simulation system capable of 50,000+ vertices 
while maintaining 60fps performance."

WEAK:
"I'm a creative problem solver"

STRONG:
"Solved a memory bottleneck in UI rendering by implementing 
object pooling, reducing memory allocation by 40%."
```

### Be Specific About Impact
```
VAGUE:
"Worked on a cool project with my team"

SPECIFIC:
"Led UI development for a multiplayer game, implementing real-time 
networking for 64 concurrent players with < 100ms latency."

VAGUE:
"Made some graphics improvements"

SPECIFIC:
"Optimized post-processing pipeline using compute shaders, 
reducing GPU time by 25% while improving visual quality."
```

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Being Too Modest
```
"I helped with some UI work on a team project"
(vs.)
"Designed and implemented interactive UI systems for menus and HUD"
```

### ❌ Being Too Boastful
```
"I single-handedly revolutionized VFX in game development"
(vs.)
"Implemented optimized VFX system that reduced particle overhead by 35%"
```

### ❌ Using Jargon Without Context
```
"Implemented GPGPU-accelerated raytraced denoising with ML upsampling"
(vs.)
"Used GPU acceleration to improve real-time ray tracing quality 
while maintaining performance targets"
```

### ❌ Being Too Long
```
Showreel description longer than 4 sentences
Project description longer than 3 sentences
Industry experience longer than 5-6 sentences
```

### ❌ Forgetting Your Audience
Remember: MSc admissions panels are looking for:
✓ Technical competency
✓ Problem-solving ability
✓ Professional communication
✓ Clear evidence of experience
✓ Passion for the subject

Write for academics/professionals, not your friends.
